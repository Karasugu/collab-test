REFLECTION - Eason, Robert, Carlos

1st answer:
Robert code the add function, the save system that allowed data to be carried on, and debugging
Eason created the github repository, code the Main function, InputCategory function, debugging, add comments
Carlos code the view_expense function, debugging, add comments


2rd answer:

The biggest challenge was finding a way to sort, and view the different expenses into categories. We brainstormed many different ideas, and came up with what is in our code now. Debugging was also quite challenging as the three of us didn't have a unified method of naming variables. Most bugs found were variables capitalized when they should be or didn't capitalize. Some other bugs we encountered were infinite loops. I (Eason), the one writing this reflection, did enjoy collaborating with others. I was able to interact with new logics, and although I still fails to fully understand them, they opens new possibilities to what I can create. I hope my group also feel the same.
